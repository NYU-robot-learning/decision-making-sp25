## Course Overview
Decision Making has made massive strides over the past decade, from monumental achievements in gaming (Atari and Go) to the seamless control of robots in diverse applications. This is a graduate-level course on Decision Making,  with a dedicated focus on practical applications and recent research breakthroughs. Students will be introduced to a broad set of topics, covering essential formalisms, latest concepts in Imitation Learning, the nuances of Behavior Cloning, and the powerful realm of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Applications across industries such as gaming, robotics, and industry will be discussed to offer a holistic perspective of the impact of decision-making in various domains. This course will involve several coding homeworks where you will implement various algorithms and a final project.

### Target Audience
This course is aimed at MSc and PhD level students in computer science / data science.

## Prerequisites
### CS / Data Science Students
> This is NOT a basic course in reinforcement learning, deep learning or AI. If you are unsure about whether you are ready to take the class, go through [Assignment 0](assignments) to test yourself.

* Graduate level knowledge of **machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning** is assumed. 
* Proficiency in **Python and PyTorch** is assumed, and will be necessary to complete the [assignments](assignments).

### For non-DS/CS Students
Please contact Rosemary Amico (amico@cs.nyu.edu).

## Logistical Overview

### Lecture
* 4:55pm-6:55pm on Fridays.
* Lectures wil be held in person.
* The class will be recorded, we will post the link to the recorded lectures to the class Campuswire [link TBD](https://campuswire.com/c/GEAA805EF/feed/).
* Please add the [Class calendar link TBD](https://google.com) to your calendar to keep track of class events (lecture, office hours, recitation, etc.).

### Grading and Assignments
* Assignments (40%) + Final Project (50%) + Class Participation (10%)
* There will be four assignments through the semester.
* Three late days are provided for late submission. No submissions will be accepted after the late days are used by the student.
* Assignments will use Python 3 and PyTorch; we will provide you a conda environment to install all dependencies.
* We strongly recommended using Python for the project as well.
<!-- * To complete the assignemnt, you would need GPU access. Use [Greene](https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/systems/greene-cluster) if you need access to one. -->

### Final Project
* Project proposals (1 page) will be due on 2/23.
* Maximum (and recommended) team size is 2.
* Final presentations of all projects will take place on 5/2/2025.

### Course Textbook
We highly recommend the following e-book: **Sutton and Barto. _[Reinforcement Learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)_**. Reading materials for each class is posted in the [syllabus](syllabus).
