<!-- ## Assignment Environment and Installation Instructions
Assignment 0 is posted [here](https://campuswire.com/c/G7204E992/feed/2) which will use Google colab for the coding portion. Future assigment environments will be released soon. -->

## Collaboration Policy
Collaboration is encouraged, but the work you submit for assignments is expected to be entirely your own. That is, the writing and code must be yours, and you must fully understand everything that you hand in. Discussing the details of how to solve a problem is fine, but you must write the solution yourself. To avoid plagiarizing, you shouldn't be looking at someone else's solution while you write down your own. If you collaborated significantly (use your own discretion for "significantly") on a problem, list the people you collaborated with next to your solution.

## Late Day Policy
Each student is allotted up to 3 late days per assignment. Late days are counted in full-day increments (24 hours) starting immediately after the deadline. Each late day incurs a 15% penalty from the maximum possible score for the assignment. Thus, within 1 late day the maximum score is 85%, within 2 late days the maximum score is 60%, and within 3 late days the maximum score is 45%. Assignments turned in more than 3 days late will receive a score of 0% to avoid unfair burdens on course graders.

If you face extraordinary circumstances (e.g., illness, emergencies), please reach out to the instructor as soon as possible with documentation acceptable by the Dean's Office. These cases will be considered individually.


## Final Project
